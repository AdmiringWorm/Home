# Cake-Contrib Guidelines & Best Practices

This document provides some guidelines and best practices for writing Cake addins hosted within the cake-contrib GitHub Organization (however, these guidelines can also be applied to addin's hosted outside the Orgnanization).

All known addins are audited twice daily to ensure compliance, and a summary report, as well as a detailed report, are generated at the conclusion of each audit.
As a Cake user you can use the [summary audit report](Audit.md) to verify if the addins you are using are compatible with the version of Cake you are using. 
As an addin author you should use the [detailed audit report](Audit.xlsx) to verify that you are complying with all recommendations.

## Naming Convention

Your addin should be named `Cake.xxx` where xxx is a meaningful and unique name that describes what your addin does. We strongly encourage you to be consistent and use the same name for the GitHub repo, the C# solution name, the assembly generated from your project and the NuGet package. The `Cake.` prefix in the naming convention is particularly important for the NuGet package and the assembly in your package, because it's used by the automated [AddinDiscoverer](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.AddinDiscoverer) to identify addins for Cake.

For example, `Cake.Email` is the name that clearly identifies the addin for Cake that allows emails to be sent from your build script. This name is used in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Email), it's the name of the [solution file](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Email/blob/develop/Source/Cake.Email.sln), it's the name of the [project file](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Email/blob/develop/Source/Cake.Email/Cake.Email.csproj), the name of the [generated assembly](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Email/blob/develop/Source/Cake.Email/Cake.Email.csproj#L10) and finally, it's also the name of the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Email/).

## NuGet Package Icon

Addins should use the Cake Contrib icon rather than the Cake icon. You can do so by adding the following line in your addin's `.csproj`:

```xml
<PackageIconUrl>https://cdn.rawgit.com/cake-contrib/graphics/a5cf0f881c390650144b2243ae551d5b9f836196/png/cake-contrib-medium.png</PackageIconUrl>
```

Like in this [example](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Email/blob/develop/Source/Cake.Email/Cake.Email.csproj#L18).

If you are still using a `.nuspec` file rather than the newer `.csproj` format, the line should look like this:

```xml
<metadata>
    <iconUrl>https://cdn.rawgit.com/cake-contrib/graphics/a5cf0f881c390650144b2243ae551d5b9f836196/png/cake-contrib-medium.png</iconUrl>
</metadata>
```

Please note that the source for the icon can be found [here](https://github.com/cake-contrib/graphics).


## Build Infrastructure

Addins which are part of the cake-contrib Organization should use the [Cake.Recipe] scripts for their build process.

## Supported Cake Version

To have the best support for different versions of Cake, the addin should currently be built against Cake version 0.28.0,
or, if a specific newer functionality is required, the lowest version providing the specific functionality. Please note 
that addins built against newer versions of Cake might not be compatible with previous versions of Cake and vice-versa,
addins built against older versions might not be compatible with future versions of Cake (this is especially true when a
future version of Cake introduces breaking changes).

It is incumbent on addin authors to upgrade their references and publish new version of their NuGet packages when a new 
version of Cake with breaking changes becomes available.

## Framework

As of Cake 0.26.0, addins should only target `netstandard2.0`. Addins *can* multi-target `net46` (or even `net461`) and
`netstandard2.0` if you have a compelling reason, but for the vast majority of addins `netstandard2.0` is sufficient. 
The reason why we recommend netstandard2.0 is that this framework is compatible with both cake and cake.coreclr.

Previously, before moving to dotnet core 2, the only way to support both cake and cake.coreclr was to multitarget (net46 and netstandard1.6). 
Nowadays thereâ€™s (in most cases) no real need to multitarget, but many addins still do (mainly because they did it earlier).

## Cake.Core / Cake.Common references

Those references are being implicitly added by the Cake engine. Thus there is no need to add them as dependencies
inside the nuspec file. This is not too hard to accomplish of you write your own nuspec file. But if you are using
`dotnet.exe pack` to create the nuget package you need to explicitly mark those references as private assets inside
the new csproj format.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Cake.Core" Version="0.28.0" PrivateAssets="All" />
  <PackageReference Include="Cake.Common" Version="0.28.0" PrivateAssets="All" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Documentation

Addins should follow the [Cake Documentation Guidelines].

## Addin documentation

The preferred tool for creating documentation for the addin is [Wyam].
The [Cake.Recipe] scripts support building [Wyam] projects and the created website can be published to
`https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.AddinName/` using a `gh-pages` branch.

For details see [How to create gh-pages branch].

## Integration on Cake website

Addins published to nuget.org should be listed on the cakebuild.net website. This is especially relevant 
to the audit process because the YAML files are used to build the list of known addins to be audited. As 
of this writing, the audit process also gathers additional known addins from the addins listed in the
"Addins" section of [Status.md](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Home/blob/master/Status.md#addins) in 
the cake-contrib GitHub repository but be aware that this manually maintained list will eventually be 
abandoned when we feel confident that most (if not all) addin author have created a YAML file for their
addins.

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/cake-build/website/blob/develop/README.md#addins) to 
create a YAML file for your addin.
