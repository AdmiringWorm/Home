# Additional audit results

Due to space constraints we couldn't fit all audit information in this report so we generated an Excel spreadsheet that contains the following additional information:
- The `Maintainer` column indicates who is maintaining the source for this project
- The `Icon` column indicates if the nuget package for your addin uses the cake-contrib icon.
- The `YAML` column indicates if there is a `.yml` file describing the addin in this [repo](https://github.com/cake-build/website/tree/develop/addins).
- The `Transferred to cake-contrib` column indicates if the project has been moved to the cake-contrib github organisation.
