# Additional audit results

Due to space constraints we couldn't fit all audit information in this report so we generated an Excel spreadsheet that contains the following additional information:
- The `Maintainer` column indicates who is maintaining the source for this project
- The `Icon` column indicates if the nuget package for your addin uses the cake-contrib icon.
- The `Transferred to cake-contrib` column indicates if the project has been moved to the cake-contrib github organisation.
- The `License` column indicates the license selected by the addin author. PLEASE NOTE: this information is only available if the nuget package includes the new `license` metadata information (documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec#license) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/msbuild-targets#packing-a-license-expression-or-a-license-file)) as opposed to the [obsolete](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/32) `licenseUrl`.

# Progress

The following graph shows the percentage of addins that are compatible with Cake over time. For the purpose of this graph, we consider an addin to be compatible with a given version of Cake if it references the desired version of Cake.Core and Cake.Common.
