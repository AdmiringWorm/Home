## Additional audit results

Due to space constraints we couldn't fit all audit information in this report so we generated an Excel spreadsheet that contains the following additional information:

- The `NuGet package version` column indicates the version of the package that was audited.
- The `Maintainer` column indicates who is maintaining the source for this project
- The `Icon` column indicates if the nuget package for your addin uses the cake-contrib icon.
- The `Transferred to cake-contrib` column indicates if the project has been moved to the cake-contrib github organization.
- The `License` column indicates the license selected by the addin author. PLEASE NOTE: this information is only available if the nuget package includes the new `license` metadata information (documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec#license) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/msbuild-targets#packing-a-license-expression-or-a-license-file)) as opposed to the [obsolete](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/32) `licenseUrl`.
- The `Repository` column indicates if the repository information is present in the package nuspec as documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec#repository) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/msbuild-targets#pack-target).
- The `cake-contrib co-owner` column indicates if the cake-contrib user is a co-owner of the nuget package.
- The `Issues count` column indicates the number of open issues in the addin's github repository.
- The `Pull requests count` column indicates the number of open pull requests in the addin's github repository.
- The `Cake.Recipe` column indicates what version of Cake.Recipe is used to build this addin.
- The `Newtonsoft.Json` column indicates what version of Newtonsoft.Json is referenced by this addin (if any).
- The `Symbols` column indicates whether we found debugging symbols in the NuGet package, in the symbols package or embedded in the DLL.
- The `SourceLink` column indicates whether the SourceLink has been configured.
- The `XML Documentation` column indicates whether XML documentation is included in the nuget package.
- The `Alias Categories` column indicates the alias categories found in the addin assembly.

## Progress

The following graph shows the percentage of addins that are compatible with Cake over time. For the purpose of this graph, we consider an addin to be compatible with a given version of Cake if it references the desired version of Cake.Core and Cake.Common.
